# MGS4 CQC & Psyche system

Requires the WoS dyna base.

A CQC system recreation based on MGS4/MGO2

BUGS TO FIX:

1. Desync on multiplayer (when playing animations as well), maybe make the functions shared?
1. Mk2 on ttt, fix slot
1. Hitboxes on npcs missmatching
1. NPCs not matching the correct colour on animations
1. Proxy animator for the NPCs needs to be adjusted so you dont see the NPCs teleporting.
1. Some specific NPCs (Barney and Alyx) become wobbly when you take their weapons with CQC+3 or CQC EX

TODO EXTRA FEATURES:

1. Prone addon support
2. Mosin nagant.
3. Third person anims for the mk2.
4. Magazines.
5. Sleep mines.
6. Other skills.
